# Social Garden - A MERN Networking Place for Greenthumbs

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/buster35)

## Description

Our motivation for this project was to apply our collective strengths in order to come up with a functioning full-stack, deployed application that is built using a MERN architecture. We decided on a meeting place that may be used by garderners to connect with one another via live chat, posts, news, weather and photos related to gardening.

Working toward developing a minimum viable product as a team helped all of us to understand the benefits of collective programming and the collective thought processes that allow an ambitious project to spring forward in leaps and bounds. This website emulates a simple social networking site, while embodying the team's hard work.

This project provided a great deal of insight into full-stack development and developing within a MERN-based environment, which includes but certainly is not limited to: RESTful programming, CRUD operations, database management, page design, command-line-interfacing, testing and deployment.
